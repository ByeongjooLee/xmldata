# Korean Modern Literary Criticism XML Data Construction

A Methodology for Digital Humanities Research on Korean Modern Literary Criticism

## Project Overview

This project provides a methodology and tools for transforming Korean modern literary criticism texts into structured XML-based data. While adhering to the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) P5 guidelines, we designed a customized schema (XSD) that reflects the unique characteristics of literary criticism.

### Key Features

- **TEI P5 Based**: XML structure following international standards
- **Criticism-Specific Markup**: Support for evaluative discourse (`<interp>`) and quotation (`<quote>`) elements
- **External Data Linkage**: Connectivity with ISNI, Wikidata, Encyclopedia of Korean Culture, etc.
- **Extensible Structure**: Expandable to semantic databases

## Markup Elements

### Core Elements

| Element | Function | Key Attributes |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| `<persName>` | Personal names (authors, critics, etc.) | `role`, `xml:id`, `ref` |
| `<title>` | Work titles, paper titles, journal names | `level`, `type` |
| `<term>` | Concepts, movements, critical terminology | `type`, `xml:id` |
| `<quote>` | Criticism and literary work quotations | `type`, `genre`, `source` |
| `<interp>` | Critical evaluation and stance | `value`, `ana` |

### Evaluation Attribute Values (`<interp>`)

- `affirmative`: Positive evaluation
- `neutral`: Neutral description
- `critical`: Negative evaluation

## File Structure

```
├── tei-criticism-schema.xsd    # XML schema definition
├── examples/                    # Example XML files
│   ├── baekchul_sample.xml     # Baek Cheol's "History of New Korean Literature" sample
│   └── kimwoochang_sample.xml  # Kim Woo-chang criticism sample

└── README_EN.md                 # English version
```

## Usage Examples

### Personal Name Markup

```xml
<persName 
  role="critic" 
  xml:id="isni-0000000084484348" 
  ref="https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0047762">
  Im Hwa
</persName>
```

### Evaluation Markup

```xml
<interp value="affirmative" ana="Positive evaluation that translation was a preparatory process for the formation of new literature">
  We can infer that it preceded as a direct preparatory process.
</interp>
```

### Quotation Markup

```xml
<quote type="direct" genre="critic" source="Kim Soo-young">
  "Poetry is the anxiety of one's own existence."
</quote>
```

## Applications

1. **XPath/XQuery Analysis**: Contextual exploration and data extraction
2. **Network Analysis**: Visualization of influence relationships between critics and authors
3. **Conceptual History Research**: Tracking historical changes in critical terminology
4. **Canon Formation Studies**: Analysis of evaluation patterns for authors/works in literary history

## External Data Connections

This schema supports connections with the following external databases:

- [ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier)](https://isni.org/)
- [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/)
